#### Abstract

Pour résoudre des enjeux dénotés dans l'un des cours d’intégration d’un programme universitaire offert en formation continue (ex. absentéisme, démotivation, désengagement et faible taux de réussite) , une démarche Scholarship of Teaching and Learning (SoTL) a été menée. Cette dernière comporte six phases soit : l’analyse, l’appropriation, la conception, l’implantation, l’évaluation et la diffusion. Étant donné la diversité et les besoins des cohortes estudiantines, une migration en formation à distance basée sur une approche inspirée de la pédagogie inversée a été initiée pour l'ensemble des cours du programme, en parallèle au présent projet. L’analyse spécifique au cours a mis en lumière l’alignement pédagogique comme étant à l’origine des enjeux susmentionnés. L’approche expérientielle et l’apprentissage par problème ont été retenus et le cours a été entièrement revu pour en maximiser l’alignement pédagogique. Le cours a été recentré autour de la planification d’une intervention en entreprise. L’implantation du nouveau projet d’apprentissage s’est faite en deux temps (2020 et 2021), mais la phase d’évaluation a été reportée au printemps 2022. Les résultats seront connus au moment de la présentation.

**Adaptive Learning Uptake in Ontario’s Post-secondary System: Factors Supporting Motivation, Implementation, and Readiness (Practice-Oriented)**

*Don Eldridge, Megan Houghton (eCampusOntario)*

[Materials](https://conference.otessa.org/index.php/conference/article/view/124)



**Keywords**: Adaptive Learning, motivation, innovation, organizational readiness

#### Abstract

Adaptive learning (AL) leverages the power of technology to continuously modify instructional content based on the behaviours and needs of learners resulting in a personalized learning experience. Adoption of AL in higher education remains low despite evidence of efficacy.  Looking specifically at the Ontario higher education context, the researchers used a mixed methods research approach to conduct an environmental scan examining the current uses of AL across the post-secondary sector and challenges to adopting AL and other innovations more broadly.  The study used a framework based upon previous work by Mirata et al. (2020) and Scaccia et al. (2015) to examine motivation, organizational capacity, and innovation specific capacity of educators and institutions as antecedents for innovations such as adaptive learning.  Findings suggest that while educators see AL as holding promise to support learner outcomes, they also see it as complex, resource intensive, and an undertaking that marks a significant departure from traditional teaching methods.  Developing a provincial training and support system for AL might serve to improve motivation, refine prioritization, and bolster confidence for adaptive learning.  The lessons learned and the recommendations made through this study will serve well others considering educational innovations in other contexts.

**Keywords**: online learning, motivation, self-determination theory, online teaching, student attribution, e-learning, autonomy, competence, relatedness

#### Abstract

Prior to the COVID-19, online learning has been gradually increasing in education (Allen & Seaman, 2010); the pandemic, however, interrupted that trajectory. Seemingly overnight, educational institutions were demanded to change in-person instruction to online (Rahman et al., 2021). One of the biggest problems in online learning has been a high rate of student dropout (Chen & Jang, 2010), experiencing pandemic waves caused an even more decrease in student motivation (Thompson et al., 2021). Student motivation predicts their engagement and successful completion of a course (Ucar & Kumtepe, 2021). Without supporting students’ motivation, decreasing dropout rate and enhancing persistence will not happen (Ng, 2019). Self-determination theory (SDT) is a powerful theory focused on enhancing motivation by satisfying three basic human needs: autonomy, competence and relatedness (Ryan & Deci, 2017). In this session, we review online learning studies that use an SDT framework to address three questions: First, have all three components of SDT been researched equally? Second, how have these components been measured in different studies? Third, are there changes in research since the onset of the pandemic; in particular, is relatedness being addressed more frequently? Finally, we provide recommendations for future research and practices at both teaching and system levels.

**Assessment and Digital Technology in Higher Education: A Review of the Literature (Research-Oriented)**

*Colin Madland (University of Victoria)*

**Keywords:** assessment, technology, higher education, approaches to assessment

[Materials](https://conference.otessa.org/index.php/conference/article/view/138)

#### Abstract

Assessment is a core component of teaching and learning in higher education and has been impacted in various ways by the growth of technology in society and education. Assessment is a process of inferring ability (knowledge or skills) based on evidence provided through the completion of various types of performance tasks. Technology has impacted assessment practices in higher education in multiple ways, including large scale admissions and certification exams, classroom assessment practices such as monitoring remote learners as they write exams, and also enabling instructors to more closely align their assessment practices with common outcomes of 21st century higher education including collaboration, problem solving, creativity, and divergent thinking. This review of the literature explores how technology has impacted assessment practices in higher education in light of the model of Pellegrino et al.'s  assessment triangle and DeLuca et al.'s approaches to classroom assessment with the objective of synthesizing current literature to inform ethical assessment policy and practice in technologically mediated higher education.

**Open Educational Resources as a Tool for Immersive EDI Professional Development (Research-Oriented)**

*[Sara Humphreys](https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6337-5828), Loren Gaudet (University of Victoria)*

[Materials](https://conference.otessa.org/index.php/conference/article/view/133)

**Keywords**: EDI, anti-racism, decolonization, academic writing, OER

#### Abstract

Currently approaches to professional development comprise workshops, teaching observations, videos, websites and other resources instructors access outside of class time. However, training in EDI and decolonialization requires immersion, sustained engagement, and connection to new pedagogical practices. This presentation offers an evidence-based case study outlining how we developed and connected instructors to Open Education Resources (OER) constructed based on local Coast Salish knowledges, anti-racism pedagogy, and wise practices in inclusivity.

The case study in question involved the creation of Why Write, an anti-racist and decolonial writing textbook for first-year students at the University of Victoria. This OER was created by an interdisciplinary team of librarians, anti-racism and inclusivity researchers, writing centre leaders, and academic writing specialists all informed by Indigenization and decolonization experts. In this presentation, we argue that anti-racist and decolonial OER such as ours offers immersive EDI professional development in two key ways: through process and through content (Bali, Cronin, and Jhangiani 2020).[1]

**Keywords**: open educational practices, open pedagogy, open education, OER, open educational resources, climate emergency, climate change

[Materials](https://conference.otessa.org/index.php/conference/article/view/123) 

#### Abstract

Education has a vital role in supporting learners across sectors in understanding the causes and impacts of environmental collapse (UNESCO, 2015) and addressing them through global citizenship, individual and collective direct action, and democratic participation. However, there's abundant evidence that educators, worldwide, lack the knowledge and skills to effectively address the climate emergency in their teaching (Teach the Future, 2021).  

This presentation explores the affordances of open educational practices and open pedagogy for climate emergency-related teaching, including how: 

- connecting learners with online communities offering inspiration and guidance can increase understanding and support effective direct action  
- connecting learners with people affected by environmental disaster can increase empathetic understanding and raise awareness of climate injustice  
- using, adapting, co-co-creating and sharing climate-emergency related open educational resources (OER) can support learners’ autonomy and agency and address feelings of powerlessness, while growing the Commons  
- using renewable assessments with real world value can contribute to community-based awareness and direct action.  

The presentation draws on research with students and educators discussing climate emergency-related teaching and will also promote, and encourage contributions to, a crowd-sourced document sharing ideas and resources to support teaching around the climate emergency using open approaches.

**Keywords**: professional developmenent, Decolonizing, Indigenous

#### Abstract

As with many graduate level programs, the X program was faced with a rapid shift to online in the face of COVID-19 restrictions. Health and travel restrictions were far greater in Nunavut than many other regions of Canada considering the limited housing and medical services in most communities. The experiential nature of educator professional development that grounds the program created both educational and ethical considerations when faced with moving online. This research shares the perceptions of the educators involved, from instructors, students and program coordinators with response to the question naamaktuk? Is it enough? In the redesign of offerings, given the challenges of technological infrastructure in Nunavut, access to tools for learning in schools and educational and language expectations, have we done enough to compensate for what was lost in this rapid shift? Responses from participants suggest there is room for improvement, and also highlight considerations for online learning design in remote communities.

#### Abstract

People of colour have experienced challenges with appearing properly in pictures since the beginning of photography. Typically, they show up as being very underexposed, looking like they are in a shadow, especially when in the same frame as people with pale skin. This problem has persisted despite significant advances in camera film and, subsequently, in digital sensor technologies in modern cameras.

Considering that most digital tools are built on a foundation of yesterday’s analog tools, this challenge has persisted in multiple forms in modern digital contexts. For example, on Twitter and on Zoom where we encountered this challenge in September 2020 during faculty meetings on Zoom. Our zoom erasure experience and subsequent Twitter crop experience raised questions for our investigation: why do people of colour experience erasure on zoom and other digital platforms? Is this problem new? What are the outcomes of our experience? How could the problem be fixed? Therefore, the purpose of this presentation is to raise awareness through sharing our experience and to educate educational technologists and instructors to support people of colour.

**Keywords**: Technology-enhanced learning environments, Communication, Collaborative Learning, Boundary Object, Social Interdependence Theory, Connectivism, Higher education

#### Abstract

The purpose of this qualitative case study is to examine how technology-enhanced learning environments (TELE’s) can foster communication and collaboration in higher education face to face classrooms. A conceptual framework that includes Social Interdependence Theory, the theory of Connectivism and the conception of technology as a boundary object will be used to guide the conduct of this study. The primary research question is: (a) How does educational technology foster communication and collaboration in face to face post-secondary classrooms? Secondary questions in this study are: (b) What is the nature of the collaborative experience for participants engaging with technology? (c) How do instructors and students view technology as a part of fostering communications? This research will serve to increase understanding about incorporating various technologies into post secondary classrooms for knowledge building, encouraging a departure from a traditional lecture format in that context and recognizing the importance of all stakeholders in the education process.

**Keywords**: feedback, artificial intelligence, learning analytics, educational data mining, assessment

[Materials](https://conference.otessa.org/index.php/conference/article/view/125)

#### Abstract

Feedback is an important part in educational assessment that improves student learning. As education changes with the advancement of technology, educational assessment has also adapted accordingly to the advent of Artificial Intelligence (AI). Despite the increasing use of online assessments during the last decade, a limited number of studies have discussed the process of feedback generation as implemented through AI. To address this gap, we propose a conceptual paper to organize and discuss the application of AI in the feedback generation and delivery processes. Among different branches of AI, Natural Language Processing (NLP), Educational Data Mining (EDM), and Learning Analytics (LA) play the most important roles in the feedback generation process. The process begins with the analysis of students’ data from educational assessments to build a predictive machine learning model with additional features such as students’ interaction with course material using EDM methods to predict students’ learning outcomes. Written feedback can be generated from a model with NLP-based algorithms before being delivered along with non-verbal feedback via a LA dashboard or a digital score report. This paper could contribute to the understanding of the feedback generation process to serve as a venue for the future development of digital feedback.
