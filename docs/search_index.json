A number of metaphors will be proposed and analysed which demonstrate how metaphors can shape our thinking and help us view educational technology from different perspectives. The Covid pandemic saw nearly all education institutions engaging in an online pivot, which usually involved online versions of existing practices, such as lectures. As we seek to build on this experience and offer a richer online experience it has become evident that the face-to-face lecture has become a dominant model that many struggle to see past. This talk will examine how different metaphors can help us approach educational technology. Sherri Spelic Hide and Seek: On Kids, Power, and Resistance in Education I want to explore what happens when the learners in our care resist our offer of help, expertise, and teaching. How do we make sense of students applying refusal skills in the classroom? Rather than provide answers I will draw on student statements about the possibility and significance of saying “no” at school and use these to probe our understanding and appreciation of power in students’ hands and voices. We’ll also pose the question: to what degree do our pedagogies leave space for negotiation and power sharing? And where does this show itself in practice? Maha Bali Outside-In: Openness as Subversion We often talk about how open education expands access, supports knowledge sharing, and potentially enhances the quality of education. We also critique open education for sometimes reproducing inequalities despite promising to promote social justice. But what about the ways in which “openness” removes/destroys barriers within us? In what ways does openness empower us from the outside-in? When does openness influence critical change and when might it fail to do so? In this interactive session, we will explore some of the things openness makes possible that are often not possible within the walls of institutions, and which can end up challenging and subverting injustice. Brenna Clarke Gray Things Unsaid: Exploring the Margins and Limits of Open Keywords: limits of open, challenges to open, autoethnography, pregnancy loss and miscarriage, institutional silences Open is not an unambiguous good, a panacea, or accessible to everyone. But maybe it could be more of all of those things if, as a community, we could talk more openly about open’s borders and limitations. What does it mean to say we are a community of open educators? What is the edge of open-ness, and how do we account for its definition? What — and whose — truths remain unsaid or unspoken even in communities that define themselves as open? And who is safe to choose open? Offering an autoethnography of pregnancy loss set against the backdrop of the pandemic university as a place to start this exploration, this talk looks to chart the margins and limits of open and to ask about the benefits of expanding the scope and possibilities of openness in our institutions. It invites all of us to imagine a more perfect open, or at least to consider how more of us can be supported to speak our things unsaid.

In addition to the devastating loss of revenue due to the absence of students on campus, criticisms of traditional testing, content relevance, equity, diversity and inclusion, the skills gap between what graduates offer and what employers are looking for brings new layers to the crisis. These issues must be overcome so that a diverse population of students can be better prepared for the increasingly demanding and complex job market caused by major technological disruptions as the world enters the age of AI and the 4th Industrial Revolution. More than ever, universities need to rethink the concept of learning experiences and learning spaces and provide opportunities for lifelong learning so that intellectual exchanges can take place both among students as peers and between students and extra-academic actors to bring greater relevance to what students learn through the curriculum. In this presentation, I will discuss the concept of an alternative university that rests on four pillars: micro-credentials, prior learning recognition, mentoring, and partnerships.

Three highschool teachers from different disciplines (Social Studies, Digital Media, and Carpentry) launched a cross-curricular inquiry-based project, focusing on truth and reconciliation, that connected the learners in their highschool and the broader community, including knowledge holders from the local Indigenous communities. Those engaged in the project examined questions around what truth and reconciliation meant to the learners and its significance. Resulting products included a legacy wall containing individual learning represented in motifs, design of the feather using wood from around the world, and a video documentary containing interviews from school and community stakeholders. We will screen clips of videos during our session, but invite participants to pre-screen the two videos (Documentary Parts 1 and 2), which can be accessed on our YouTube playlist, where a process video and a reflection video are also available.

Working within an open, online university, we are investigating the nature and extent to which we use OEP and co-mentorship, and exploring the outcomes for ourselves and our students. We seek to reduce hierarchical relationships, prioritizing student-centred practices. We aim to improve ourselves as open, flexible distance educators and to support successful student learning and research. Consistent with CAE, we are collecting self-reflective and dialogic data, and artefacts from our co-mentorship and open educational practices. As participants in this study, we are experiencing the power of CAE as a research method that moves us beyond traditional discourse leading to personal and professional growth. We anticipate that our research findings will help position our graduates and ourselves as creative thinkers, learners, and contributors in the 21st century during these times of critical change.

For a number of years, groups of TRU students have been building a CURN website as part of their undergraduate research ambassador roles, adding to each other’s work every semester: curn.trubox.ca/. Since the start of the initiative, the objective has been to create an open resource that would get students interested and engaged in undergraduate research. Designed as an open pedagogy project, student research ambassadors were given the autonomy to choose the format and the structure of the resource, decide which topics to include, what they wanted to learn from the project, and how to organize their groups and creative efforts. 2:45-3:45: – Transitions of Online Learning and Teaching – PSE Online Building digital fluency skills during the rapid transition to online and hybrid teaching through open access with the Ontario Extend program (Practice-Oriented) Alissa Bigelow (eCampusOntario) Keywords: online, transitions, teaching and learning, Ontario Extend Abstract At a time of unprecedented change within the educational system due to the COVID-19 global pandemic, the Ontario Extend professional learning program provides a platform for community, collaboration, and digital fluency skill development amongst postsecondary educators across the province of Ontario. A key driver for the Ontario Extend program is to provide educators with the ability to leverage diverse educational technology tools to create a more accessible learning environment for students in online and hybrid learning environments. The program framework builds upon “The 21st Century Educator” model (Bates, 2016), which encompasses the knowledge, skills, and attitudes identified as the foundational skills required to “thrive (and not just survive) in a digital world” (Coldwell-Nelson, 2018; Martin &amp; Grudziecki, 2006). Educators are encouraged to engage with six online modules and reflect upon specific elements of their teaching practice. Each of the six modules promotes a learning journey focused on a combination of foundational upskilling and reskilling, with digital badges awarded upon the completion of each module. Once an educator has completed all six modules, they are awarded the Empowered Educator micro-credential and join the growing community of Extend educators. This session will provide an overview of the program and scaling efforts to date, with time for questions.

In this session, we will present a review of research on mental health / well-being and online or remote learning. Our preliminary analyses suggest that little scholarship existed prior to 2020 and that most of these studies have been conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic. We report three findings: (a) it’s very difficult, if not impossible, to control for pandemic effects in the data, (b) studies present a very mixed picture, with variability around how mental health and well-being are measured and how / whether any causal inferences are made in relation to online and remote learning, and (c) results across these studies are extremely mixed. Based on this study, we suggest that researchers, policymakers, practitioners, and administrators exercise extreme caution around making generalizable assertions with respect to the impacts of online/remote learning and mental health. Break (5:30 - 6:00) Parallel Session 4 (6:00 - 6:45) Invited Speakers Parallel Session 4.1 Land-use Metaphor in Scholarly Communication: A Brief Inventory and Inspection AJ Boston Keywords: scholarly communication, metaphor, analogy, open access Abstract Practitioners in information-centered fields regularly use metaphors in the professional literature and in everyday use. Many of these are based on land use or a general understanding of the natural sciences, and sometimes (but not always) relate to a broader metaphorical concept of information ecology or information ecosystem. Discourse in fields like scholarly communication is no exception. What I recommend in this presentation is that we begin to take inventory of our earthly metaphors in scholarly communication. Then, through a deliberate inspection of our metaphorical concepts, we can check whether the assumptions each implies are consistent with our values and do not lead us to draw false, misleading, or premature conclusions. In recognizing the usefulness and effect of metaphors, we should seek to replace old ones when they cease to bear wise fruit. Parallel Session 4.2 Critical Change in Online Education - What We Can Learn (And Not Learn) From COVID as a Context Matt Bower Keywords: Online Learning, COVID-19, Technology-Mediated Learning Theory, Comprehensive Evaluation of the Use of Technology in Education Abstract The COVID-19 pandemic prompted the rapid transformation of education worldwide, catapulting technology in some people’s eyes from being the villain of education to the hero. As international education returns to some degree of normalcy, what can we really learn from the COVID-19 experience? This presentation using Technology Mediated Learning Theory and the Comprehensive Evaluation and Use of Technology In Education framework to identify what we can, and cannot learn, based on the argument that the COVID-19 pandemic has been, and can only ever be, an educational context. Identifying the attributes of the COVID-19 context, and how those attributes have shaped education, can then provide insights that may in turn be transferred to other times, places, and people. The increased role of parents in the education of children is taken as a case in point, with data revealing how the design of online learning should be changed to account for parental knowledge, responsibilities, perspectives and preferences. Implications for the design and study of online learning are discussed. Discussion/Networking Pods (6:45 – 7:00) …or until the end of your conversation!

Specifically, I explore the interdependence of in-person and online logics of schooling drawing from my research in Ontario secondary schools as well as experience teaching online for over a decade. As we attempt to bridge theory and practice, how can we attend to the variety of contexts within which online education emerges, as a response to underfunding in public education, as a collective imaginary that shapes education policy. What does it mean to reimagine online education alongside reimagining in the institutions and politics that structure schooling? During my talk, I encourage the audience to think about education, community, and democracy together, to challenge the value-neutrality of technology, which is not separate from but dependent upon our social and cultural context. Parallel Session 5.2 Shaping ‘the new normal’: Reflection and Design for Iterating Forward Stephanie Moore, University of New Mexico Keywords: reflective practice, design as agency Abstract Schön (1983) describes reflection-in-action as a sort of conversation that designers engage in throughout the design process and with the situation. Whitbeck (1996) defines ethics not as evaluating or judging to determine right or wrong but as a process of design, of devising possible courses of action in response to moral problems. In this session, these two principles – reflection and design – form the basis for shaping our responses to the needs illuminated by the pandemic and rhetoric around “the new normal.” This session will feature time for reflection on desirable visions of “new normals” and discussion of themes across our visions. We then explore together Whitbeck’s idea of “ethics as design” and how that can be used to enact a vision of a new normal through our design processes and the designed products or environments we create. Our exploration of design as way to enact a new normal will include a “design inspiration exhibit” with time for touring ideas and then exploration of how and where a vision of a “new normal” may be integrated into both instructional design and planning as well as educational systems designs.

Cette dernière comporte six phases soit : l’analyse, l’appropriation, la conception, l’implantation, l’évaluation et la diffusion. Étant donné la diversité et les besoins des cohortes estudiantines, une migration en formation à distance basée sur une approche inspirée de la pédagogie inversée a été initiée pour l’ensemble des cours du programme, en parallèle au présent projet. L’analyse spécifique au cours a mis en lumière l’alignement pédagogique comme étant à l’origine des enjeux susmentionnés. L’approche expérientielle et l’apprentissage par problème ont été retenus et le cours a été entièrement revu pour en maximiser l’alignement pédagogique.

Adoption of AL in higher education remains low despite evidence of efficacy. Looking specifically at the Ontario higher education context, the researchers used a mixed methods research approach to conduct an environmental scan examining the current uses of AL across the post-secondary sector and challenges to adopting AL and other innovations more broadly. The study used a framework based upon previous work by Mirata et al. (2020) and Scaccia et al. (2015) to examine motivation, organizational capacity, and innovation specific capacity of educators and institutions as antecedents for innovations such as adaptive learning. Findings suggest that while educators see AL as holding promise to support learner outcomes, they also see it as complex, resource intensive, and an undertaking that marks a significant departure from traditional teaching methods. Developing a provincial training and support system for AL might serve to improve motivation, refine prioritization, and bolster confidence for adaptive learning. The lessons learned and the recommendations made through this study will serve well others considering educational innovations in other contexts. Parallel Session 6.4 Teaching, learning, and assessment activities used in additional language courses in blended contexts in Quebec’s higher education (Research-Oriented) Paula Andrea Arancibia Erazo (Université de Sherbrooke) Students Feel More Dignified”: Alternative Grading and Self-Assessment in Online Courses (Research-Oriented) Sharon Lauricella (Ontario Tech University) Student Motivation in Online Learning Based on Self Determination Theory: A Literature Review (Research-Oriented) Behnoosh Khoramrooz, Valerie Irvine, Joan Martin (University of Victoria) Keywords: online learning, motivation, self-determination theory, online teaching, student attribution, e-learning, autonomy, competence, relatedness Abstract Prior to the COVID-19, online learning has been gradually increasing in education (Allen &amp; Seaman, 2010); the pandemic, however, interrupted that trajectory. Seemingly overnight, educational institutions were demanded to change in-person instruction to online (Rahman et al., 2021). One of the biggest problems in online learning has been a high rate of student dropout (Chen &amp; Jang, 2010), experiencing pandemic waves caused an even more decrease in student motivation (Thompson et al., 2021). Student motivation predicts their engagement and successful completion of a course (Ucar &amp; Kumtepe, 2021). Without supporting students’ motivation, decreasing dropout rate and enhancing persistence will not happen (Ng, 2019). Self-determination theory (SDT) is a powerful theory focused on enhancing motivation by satisfying three basic human needs: autonomy, competence and relatedness (Ryan &amp; Deci, 2017). In this session, we review online learning studies that use an SDT framework to address three questions: First, have all three components of SDT been researched equally? Second, how have these components been measured in different studies? Third, are there changes in research since the onset of the pandemic; in particular, is relatedness being addressed more frequently? Finally, we provide recommendations for future research and practices at both teaching and system levels. Assessment and Digital Technology in Higher Education: A Review of the Literature (Research-Oriented) Colin Madland (University of Victoria) Keywords: assessment, technology, higher education, approaches to assessment Abstract Assessment is a core component of teaching and learning in higher education and has been impacted in various ways by the growth of technology in society and education. Assessment is a process of inferring ability (knowledge or skills) based on evidence provided through the completion of various types of performance tasks. Technology has impacted assessment practices in higher education in multiple ways, including large scale admissions and certification exams, classroom assessment practices such as monitoring remote learners as they write exams, and also enabling instructors to more closely align their assessment practices with common outcomes of 21st century higher education including collaboration, problem solving, creativity, and divergent thinking. This review of the literature explores how technology has impacted assessment practices in higher education in light of the model of Pellegrino et al.’s assessment triangle and DeLuca et al.’s approaches to classroom assessment with the objective of synthesizing current literature to inform ethical assessment policy and practice in technologically mediated higher education. Parallel Session 6.5 - WildCard – PSE Open 2:15-2:45 Open Educational Resources as a Tool for Immersive EDI Professional Development (Research-Oriented) Sara Humphreys, Loren Gaudet (University of Victoria) Keywords: EDI, anti-racism, decolonization, academic writing, OER Abstract Currently approaches to professional development comprise workshops, teaching observations, videos, websites and other resources instructors access outside of class time. However, training in EDI and decolonialization requires immersion, sustained engagement, and connection to new pedagogical practices. This presentation offers an evidence-based case study outlining how we developed and connected instructors to Open Education Resources (OER) constructed based on local Coast Salish knowledges, anti-racism pedagogy, and wise practices in inclusivity. The case study in question involved the creation of Why Write, an anti-racist and decolonial writing textbook for first-year students at the University of Victoria. This OER was created by an interdisciplinary team of librarians, anti-racism and inclusivity researchers, writing centre leaders, and academic writing specialists all informed by Indigenization and decolonization experts. In this presentation, we argue that anti-racist and decolonial OER such as ours offers immersive EDI professional development in two key ways: through process and through content (Bali, Cronin, and Jhangiani 2020).[1] [1] Bali, M., Cronin, C., &amp; Jhangiani, R.

DOI: http://doi.org/10.5334/jime.565 2:45-3:45 Addressing the climate crisis through open pedagogy and practices: Affordances and challenges (Research-Oriented) Leigh-Anne Perryman (The Open University UK) Keywords: open educational practices, open pedagogy, open education, OER, open educational resources, climate emergency, climate change Abstract Education has a vital role in supporting learners across sectors in understanding the causes and impacts of environmental collapse (UNESCO, 2015) and addressing them through global citizenship, individual and collective direct action, and democratic participation. However, there’s abundant evidence that educators, worldwide, lack the knowledge and skills to effectively address the climate emergency in their teaching (Teach the Future, 2021). This presentation explores the affordances of open educational practices and open pedagogy for climate emergency-related teaching, including how: connecting learners with online communities offering inspiration and guidance can increase understanding and support effective direct action connecting learners with people affected by environmental disaster can increase empathetic understanding and raise awareness of climate injustice using, adapting, co-co-creating and sharing climate-emergency related open educational resources (OER) can support learners’ autonomy and agency and address feelings of powerlessness, while growing the Commons using renewable assessments with real world value can contribute to community-based awareness and direct action. The presentation draws on research with students and educators discussing climate emergency-related teaching and will also promote, and encourage contributions to, a crowd-sourced document sharing ideas and resources to support teaching around the climate emergency using open approaches.

A question of balancing professional learning needs of educators and online learning in Nunavut (Research-Oriented) Lizzie Iblauk, Kathy Snow, Diane Montgomery (University of Prince Edward Island) Keywords: professional developmenent, Decolonizing, Indigenous Abstract As with many graduate level programs, the X program was faced with a rapid shift to online in the face of COVID-19 restrictions. Health and travel restrictions were far greater in Nunavut than many other regions of Canada considering the limited housing and medical services in most communities. The experiential nature of educator professional development that grounds the program created both educational and ethical considerations when faced with moving online. This research shares the perceptions of the educators involved, from instructors, students and program coordinators with response to the question naamaktuk? Is it enough? In the redesign of offerings, given the challenges of technological infrastructure in Nunavut, access to tools for learning in schools and educational and language expectations, have we done enough to compensate for what was lost in this rapid shift? Responses from participants suggest there is room for improvement, and also highlight considerations for online learning design in remote communities.

(Practice-Oriented) Colin Madland (University of Victoria), Maxwell Ofosuhene (Trinity Western University), and Jennifer Adkins (Trinity Western University) Keywords: racial discrimination, algorithmic bias, software, technology, erasure Abstract People of colour have experienced challenges with appearing properly in pictures since the beginning of photography. Typically, they show up as being very underexposed, looking like they are in a shadow, especially when in the same frame as people with pale skin. This problem has persisted despite significant advances in camera film and, subsequently, in digital sensor technologies in modern cameras. Considering that most digital tools are built on a foundation of yesterday’s analog tools, this challenge has persisted in multiple forms in modern digital contexts. For example, on Twitter and on Zoom where we encountered this challenge in September 2020 during faculty meetings on Zoom. Our zoom erasure experience and subsequent Twitter crop experience raised questions for our investigation: why do people of colour experience erasure on zoom and other digital platforms? Is this problem new? What are the outcomes of our experience? How could the problem be fixed? Therefore, the purpose of this presentation is to raise awareness through sharing our experience and to educate educational technologists and instructors to support people of colour. Parallel Session 7.3 – Sustaining Positive Change: PSE Humanizing with Humility: The Challenge of Creating Caring, Compassionate, and Critical Educational Spaces in Higher Education (Practice-Oriented) Sarah Driessens (Nipissing University), Michelann Parr (Nipissing University) The Role of Technology in Fostering Communication and Collaboration in Post Secondary Face to Face Classrooms (Research-Oriented) Melanie Opmeer (University of Calgary) Keywords: Technology-enhanced learning environments, Communication, Collaborative Learning, Boundary Object, Social Interdependence Theory, Connectivism, Higher education Abstract The purpose of this qualitative case study is to examine how technology-enhanced learning environments (TELE’s) can foster communication and collaboration in higher education face to face classrooms. A conceptual framework that includes Social Interdependence Theory, the theory of Connectivism and the conception of technology as a boundary object will be used to guide the conduct of this study. The primary research question is: (a) How does educational technology foster communication and collaboration in face to face post-secondary classrooms? Secondary questions in this study are: (b) What is the nature of the collaborative experience for participants engaging with technology? (c) How do instructors and students view technology as a part of fostering communications? This research will serve to increase understanding about incorporating various technologies into post secondary classrooms for knowledge building, encouraging a departure from a traditional lecture format in that context and recognizing the importance of all stakeholders in the education process. Parallel Session 7.4 – Transitions of Online Learning and Teaching – PSE Online Turning to uncertainty for online learning (Practice-Oriented) David Cormier, University of Windsor Parallel Session 7.5 – Transitions of Online Learning and Teaching: PSE Feedback Generation through Artificial Intelligence (Research-Oriented) Okan Bulut, Tarid Wongvorachan (University of Alberta) Keywords: feedback, artificial intelligence, learning analytics, educational data mining, assessment Abstract Feedback is an important part in educational assessment that improves student learning. As education changes with the advancement of technology, educational assessment has also adapted accordingly to the advent of Artificial Intelligence (AI). Despite the increasing use of online assessments during the last decade, a limited number of studies have discussed the process of feedback generation as implemented through AI. To address this gap, we propose a conceptual paper to organize and discuss the application of AI in the feedback generation and delivery processes. Among different branches of AI, Natural Language Processing (NLP), Educational Data Mining (EDM), and Learning Analytics (LA) play the most important roles in the feedback generation process. The process begins with the analysis of students’ data from educational assessments to build a predictive machine learning model with additional features such as students’ interaction with course material using EDM methods to predict students’ learning outcomes. Written feedback can be generated from a model with NLP-based algorithms before being delivered along with non-verbal feedback via a LA dashboard or a digital score report. This paper could contribute to the understanding of the feedback generation process to serve as a venue for the future development of digital feedback.

Elle examine les progrès d’IRRODL, qui est passé d’une revue en ligne naissante à l’une des revues les plus lues et citées dans notre domaine. Il examine ensuite les modèles or, argent et platine de publication formelle, le développement de ces modèles dans le monde quasi monopolistique de l’édition commerciale, l’impact des revues et conférences prédatrices. Enfin, la présentation examine les opportunités et les défis présentés par les modèles de publication au noir qui échappent aux restrictions du droit d’auteur. Parallel Session 8.2 Exploring the Inquiry Classroom Trevor Mackenzie, Greater Victoria School District (#61) Keywords: inquiry, constructivism, student-centred learning, student agency, curiosity Abstract Trevor will talk about his work supporting schools in implementing inquiry, how to scaffold for student agency, and what strong inquiry schools do to build a culture of inquiry for both students and teachers. Trevor will share structures for cultivating curiosity and engaging learners as partners in designing the learning experience. Participants will experience research with Trevor. You will engage in reflective routines, skill structures, and explore resources that you can take back to your school and context, regardless of your role and position. One of Trevor’s inquiry values is that inquiry-based learning is not just something our students do. Strong cultures of inquiry create the conditions for all stakeholders to engage in curiosity, wonder and inquiry, whether you are a teacher, coordinator or administrator. Time spent with Trevor will transcend context while having personal relevance and meaning for each of you. Discussion/Networking Pods (6:45 – 7:00) …or until the end of your conversation!

Intersectional feminism considers identities to be made up of multiple social dimensions, including gender, race, sexuality, and class (Crenshaw, 1989). Because of my intersectional feminist leanings, as an academic, instructor, and learning designer, I have adopted a philosophy of feminist pedagogy. According to Shrewsbury (1987), feminist pedagogy is a philosophy of teaching/learning processes that guides our choice of classroom practices in which a community of learners is empowered to act responsibly toward each other and toward the subject matter. Feminist pedagogy also encourages us to apply what we learn to social action. For learning design practitioners and instructors, incorporating the principles of feminist pedagogy stimulates the design and development of more equitable, inclusive and transformative learning experiences. The discourse related to feminist pedagogy in the field of learning design aims to move the field toward “universal” design that considers the needs of all learners while promoting agency, equity, empowerment, and social justice. Parallel Session 9.2 Using Wikimedia as a Teaching Tool: How Wikidata can support Indigenous and low resource languages on the internet Sadik Shahadu Keywords: Wikidata, Lexicography, Lexemes, Languages, Wikimedia Abstract Since Wikidata’s inception in 2012, the multilingual knowledge base was primarily focused on concepts: Q-items are related to a thing or idea, not the word that describes it. As of 2018, Wikidata also stores a new type of data: words, phrases and sentences, in many languages, described in many languages. This information is stored in new types of entities, called Lexemes (L), Forms (F), and Senses (S). This presentation will focus on how you can use Wikimedia as a teaching tool, the lexicographic data of Wikidata: from word records, to lexemes and beyond.

Within our context, we noticed a similar trend: student disengagement in asynchronous activities. The purpose of this presentation is to support teachers in evolving online learning environments as it is not a simple matter of digitizing existing content and placing it online. Pedagogy for online learning includes deliberate planning and implementation of teacher presence, one key component for a successful transition. We have created a resource which outlines strategies to increase teacher presence in online learning environments. Our hope is that educators new to teaching online will be able to engage students asynchronously using these strategies. 3:15-3:45 – K12, PSE, Society Implementation of Education Technology in Canada: A Comparison with Korea, Finland and the EU (Research-Oriented) Keith Rispin (West Vancouver School District &amp; University of Victoria), Valerie Irvine (University of Victoria) Keywords: technology adoption, technology implementation, educational change, learner equity, government planning, access to education Abstract In this session, we look at how education technology in Canada is distributed to K-12 students and ask whether or not it can be done in a more effective, equitable, and cost-efficient manner. It is recognized that inequity in education already exists across the country, which has been tolerated pre-pandemic, but these inequities have been exacerbated as a result of the pandemic (Stewart, 2020). Our geographical expanse, combined with the decentralized manner in which education in Canada is delivered, creates significant challenges. Education is also a provincial mandate as per the constitution (Government of Canada, 2021). In this session, we will review federal strategies for technology planning in different countries around the world (e.g., Korea, Finland, the European Union, etc.). After providing an environmental scan of these national strategic plans worldwide, we will provide recommendations for national leadership and policy development. Parallel Session 10.2 – Transitions of Online Learning and Teaching: PSE Online 2:15-2:45 Taking Experiential Learning Online During COVID-19 (Research-Oriented) Theodora Kapoyannis, Astrid Kendrick, Patricia Danyluk (University of Calgary) 2:45-3:45 What we do today will change what happens tomorrow – Exploring university teaching during a pandemic to derive recommendations for post-pandemic times (Research-Oriented) Joerdis Weilandt, Sandra Dixon, Richelle Marynowski, Lorraine Beaudin, Rumi Graham, Stavroula Malla, Angeliki Pantazi (University of Lethbridge) Parallel Session 10.3 – Addressing the New Inequities: PSE 2:15-2:45 Co-designing OER with Learners: A Replacement to Traditional College Level Assessments (Practice-Oriented) Kimberlee Carter, Maria Camila Redondo Morant (Conestoga College) Keywords: Open, OER, Open Educational Resources, Co-Construction with Learners, Co-design with Learners Abstract Academic integrity issues in higher education have been reported as increasing as the pandemic and need to learn remotely continues. The use of homework sites like Chegg, that provide learners with answers to tests and assignments increased significantly through 2019 and 2020 (Walsh et al., 2021). Open advocates have been espousing the benefits of open educational resource assignments co-constructed with learners and published in the open prior to the pandemic. These have largely been writing assignments taking the form of blogs with a focus on teaching practices. An example of this phenomenon is the Open Learner Patchbook where learners write blog posts to share in the open (Open Education Global, 2019). A faculty involved in two projects that co-designed Open Education Resources (OER) with learners was curious to know what processes learned could be applied to co-designing OER assignments in their own teaching practice as an alternative to traditional assessments where answers can be found on homework sites. Easton et al. (2019) propose that original assignments encourage learners to complete their own work. This presentation focuses on what was learned in the co-design process with learners and what can be applied to teaching practices in college diploma and certificate courses. 2:45-3:45 A Critical Examination of Learner-Educator Co-Creation Within a Course (Practice-Oriented) Laura Killam (Queens University), Jess Mitchell (Ontario College of Art and Design University) Keywords: Co-creation, Open Pedagogy, Co-design Abstract Co-creation is an open practice where learners participate in decision-making about aspects of course design, which in our context has included designing assessments and/or determining grades. Co-creation may also include other aspects of course design such as content curation and course planning. Engaging a whole class of learners in co-creation may liberate learners to think critically and develop their evaluative judgment because agency, reflection, and authenticity are embedded in learner-educator interactions. These cognitive skills are essential for graduates to challenge oppression and inequity in their own careers, which has a cascading impact on society. Involving students in decision making also improves learner motivation and engagement in learning. We have witnessed tremendous growth among students through co-creation but have also faced barriers to and criticism of its use. For example, challenges include fostering trusting relationships in large classes, promoting inclusion of diverse voices, and balancing workload. In this discussion, we invite multidisciplinary co-creators to explore strategies for lasting change. We hope to discuss co-creation benefits, challenges, and potential solutions to these challenges. Even though co-creation is a unique experience for each group, ongoing discussion of how to deal with potential barriers may increase our collective readiness to empower future learners.

Les auteurs expliqueront également comment le fait de proposer plusieurs méthodes aux étudiants pour une même évaluation peut contribuer à répondre à leurs différents besoins et préférences sans augmenter la charge de travail des enseignants. En outre, les auteurs discuteront de la manière dont la diversification des méthodes d’évaluation grâce aux technologies entraîne souvent une transformation des modalités d’évaluation vers des processus continus ou itératifs comprenant des rétroactions multiples de la part des personnes enseignantes, en soutien aux apprentissages des étudiants. 2:45-3:15 – Transitions of Online Learning and Teaching: PSE Quels nouveaux modèles d’affaires pour supporter les communautés de pratique en éducation? (Practice-Oriented) Robert Grégoire, Jacques Cool, Olivier Alfieri (Réseau d’enseignement francophone à distance) Keywords: Français Abstract With the advent of the so-called 21st century skills which involve information and communication technology, the educational sphere has entered a significant turmoil period. Like so many other domains in which established practices have been upended by Internet-distributed innovative platforms, the traditional actors in education are presented with a multiplicity of potential solutions while their own viability is often questioned. Like established teaching institutions, public and private educational organizations face this new reality, particularly in the distance learning domain where the COVID-19 pandemic has exponentially accelerated those transformations. Our not-for-profit distance learning organization, francophone and pan-canadian in nature, has therefore launched a review of its business model seeking to explore four main topics: the organization and benefits ot communities of practice, emerging accreditation alternatives, the continuums of the freemium - premium model, and the intangible benefits of membership. Four online panels hosted by two industry experts and their guests will explore the main issues around those themes. Interviews with organizations similar in nature will document various membership models and fee structure. This presentation will summarize the tendancies and reflective thinking after three of our online panel series. Parallel Session 10.5 2:15-2:45 – Sustaining Positive Change – PSE Online Orlando: Broadening the Conversation on Women’s Writing Through A Scholarly Podcast (Practice-Oriented) Christie Hurrell, Karen Bourrier, Kathryn Holland, Jessica J Khuu (University of Calgary) Keywords: scholarly podcast, women’s writing Abstract Orlando: A Podcast on Women’s Writing focuses on the history of women’s writing from medieval times to the present, with a particular interest in the material conditions that enable women’s writing. Taking cues from the bespoke semantic markup of the digital textbase for which it is named, Orlando: A History of Women’s Writing from the Beginnings to the Present, the podcast stimulates discussion about the conditions of possibility for women’s writing and the goals of feminist literary history. Building on the work of McMenemy (2018), Copeland and MacGregor (2020) and others, both the form and the content of the podcast allow the Orlando team to expand, open, and challenge traditional conceptions of scholarly knowledge, and how this knowledge is communicated. By adopting conventions such as peer review and digital archiving, the podcast asserts itself as a legitimate form of scholarship and as a potential Open Educational Resource; at the same time, its conversational and accessible style challenges norms of publishing, teaching, and learning. In this presentation, the Orlando team will share lessons learned from this technology-enabled, open project and how they see it contributing to a more equitable, diverse and democratic discussion of women writers and women’s writing, broadly construed. 2:45-3:45 – Addressing the New Inequities A(nother) Guide for Resisting EdTech: The Case Against (or For?) Course Hero (Practice-Oriented) Brenna Clarke Gray (Thompson Rivers University) Keywords: educational technology, critical digital pedagogy, open processes, modelling processes Abstract Using Sean Michael Morris and Jesse Stommel’s landmark essay “A Guide for Resisting EdTech: The Case Against Turnitin.” as its foil, this presentation asks participants to apply the same kinds of critiques applied effectively to Turnitin in that piece to Course Hero as we evaluate its claims against the benchmarks of ethical educational technologies. This experiment in collective meaning-making provides a model for critiquing tools that have been carefully marketed but not well-studied by academics, offering a “way in” to these discussions that is rooted in the practical and factual, and not so profoundly shaped by personalities of influence.

It goes without saying that no student should be harmed in the pursuit of their education. A growing area of research has begun to look at how trauma and retraumatization affect learning in tertiary education in a face-to-face modality. Fewer studies have explored trauma, and its effects, in online classes. This presentation describes a study that uses a constructivist grounded theory approach to examine how college instructors think about and design trauma-informed practices in both their online and face-to-face classes. Using dimensional analysis, the core dimension that emerged from the data was Creating a Learning Environment of Care. A model for the process of Creating a Learning Environment of Care is provided along with a model for Creating a Learning environment of Care online. Theoretical propositions and practical applications are provided based on the data from this research.

Covid-19 and the development of synchronous video have changed this. Online learning and especially blended learning will become increasingly important, both for economic and pedagogical reasons. But we must learn from the past to ensure the quality of our future use of digital technologies. This presentation will address (a) what we have learned about successful e-learning design (b) how teaching and learning must change to meet the needs of 21st century learners and (c) the critical role that digital technologies will play in this transition. Parallel Session 12.2 Indigenous Representation in the Academy and Beyond Lyn Trudeau, Brock University Keywords: representation visual reconciliation Anishinaabe storytelling Abstract Indigenous representation in academia has implications that extend beyond educational institutions, and must be synonymous with poor/non-representation with respect to the Indigenous population. Visual components in academic areas that are meant to reflect the history, present and future of Aboriginal people will be expressed from an Anishinaabe perspective. In addition, the importance of personal and collective storytelling and truth will be emphasized.

However, it is possible to think that digital inequalities are configured upstream from the use of technologies by educational actors. From this systemic perspective, inequalities of use represent the culmination of a process of configuration of digital inequalities that begins with the design of educational technologies. To account for this, we draw on “social shaping of technology” studies from a critical perspective, borrowing the “script” metaphor developed by Akrich and Latour (1992). Applied to digital inequalities in education, the design and use of educational technologies constitute one and the same process during which power scripts are progressively forged and stabilized by certain actors (industrial, political, IT, educational) at the expense of others, particularly educational actors from disadvantaged environments. Thus, digital inequalities result from the greater or lesser convergence between the educational actors targeted by the design of educational technologies and those who use them. Parallel Session 13.2 The Ripple Effect: Reflecting Upon and Developing an Open Learning Identity Through the Pandemic and Beyond Verena Roberts, Thompson Rivers University Keywords: open advocate, open identity, open educational practices, open learning design Abstract At the beginning of the pandemic, I had just completed my dissertation research which considered the potential of open educational practices in high school contexts. I was excited to go back into K-12 to help support my perceived need for open and online learning during the time of remote access learning. However, I quickly learned that the open learning design intervention (OLDI) principles and findings from my research (Roberts, 2019) had more prospects in Higher Education than in K-12 contexts. As I transitioned through short-term contract positions, I am now a contract Instructional Designer at TRU (Thompson Rivers University) supporting the ZTC Associate Science diploma pathway. My reflective writing and open learning experiences in open pandemic pedagogy (Havemann &amp; Roberts, 2021), open participatory practices including blogging (DeWaard &amp; Roberts, 2021), collaborative picture books (Roberts et. al, 2020), twitter (Brown &amp; Roberts, 2022) and podcasts (Roberts &amp; Neutzling, 2022) and open learning design (Roberts, 2021; Brown et. al, 2021) has inspired my future open research opportunities (Roberts et al., 2022). This talk will tell the story of how the pandemic experiences helped me envision the potential of the Ripple Effect which encouraged me to balance my open learning designer identity with my professional reality. Participants will be encouraged to consider their open learning journeys and how to be an open learning advocate in spirit and as a calling. Break (1:45 – 2:15) Parallel Session 14 (2:15 – 3:45) Parallel Session 14.1 – Transitions of Online Learning and Teaching: PSE 2:15-2:45 Évolution de pratiques pédagogiques inclusives au collégial en contexte pandémique (Research-Oriented) Géraldine Heilporn (Université Laval), Simon Larose (Université Laval), Catherine Beaulieu (Cégep de Saint-Laurent, Montréal, Québec) 2:45-3:45 Aspirations for post pandemic teaching and learning: Stepping stones for future possibilities Lisa Gedak (Royal Roads University &amp; Kwantlen Polytechnic University) Keywords: Appreciative Inquiry, Online Learning, Educational Development, Tech-enhanced Practices, COVID-19 Pivot Abstract COVID-19 disrupted educational contexts worldwide, providing a possible catalyst for the transformation of teaching and learning. However, without thoughtful reflection and purposeful planning, a post-pandemic return to the status quo seemed likely. The presenters believe that what we focus on determines our perception, and a vision for an ideal future supports purposeful action in that direction. This session shares the findings of two distinctive studies. Conducted in unique contexts, both applied an Appreciative Inquiry (AI) approach to explore experiences during the pandemic to identify what is needed for future learning environments. Gedak (2021) examined a British Columbian K-12 school community’s experiences during the pandemic and utilized an AI SOAR approach with hopes of positively impacting future district decisions related to education delivery. Waddington (2021) guided a group of post-secondary faculty through an AI-based professional development series to support them to reflect on their initial experience teaching online to identify strengths and opportunities for development and support future adoption of technology and online delivery models. The respective findings suggest applicability in other contexts. This session aims to foster dialogue around maximizing the impact of pandemic teaching and learning experiences to meet the needs of diverse learners in a changing world. Parallel Session 14.2 – Sustaining Positive Change: K12 Online 2:15-2:45 Project MIXITÉ: Towards a Numér-ACTIF process of the intervention plan promoting the active participation of the student, his parents, and interprofessional collaborative practices (Practice-Oriented) Audrey Raynault Abstract Research agrees on the fact that the student who actively participates in the process of his plan of intervention (IP) is positively linked to the commitment of the parents in the latter, to the desired learning results, to an increase in the number of high school diplomas in addition to encouraging interprofessional collaboration. Unfortunately, research highlights that practitioners make little use of their collaborative practices and insufficiently promote student agency during the IEP process. The MIXITÉ collaborative research project adopts a collaborative partnership approach in which adults collaborate and maximize their agency and that of the student in the Digital-ACTIVE process of their IP. A collaborative methodology taking place at a distance allowed students, their parents and teachers, the management and the psychoeducator of a school, a patient-partner, social workers and managers of a CIUSSS to co-create two strategies to be implemented. attempt to improve collaborative practices focused on student agency in their IP. This communication presents 1) the process of the IP Digital-ACTIVE to be tested and 2) the planning of intersectoral meetings in order to better understand the roles of each and create cohesion between the actors. 2:45-3:45 Professional Learning and Online Tutoring Michael Canuel (LearnQuebec) Keywords: Online tutoring, Professional learning Abstract There is considerable anecdotal evidence that online tutoring benefits students who participate in these virtual sessions, however, there is also reason to believe that there are numerous advantages for the online tutors who modify, improve, and review their regular classroom practice as a result of their work in the online environment. While working in this virtual environment, these tutors have the opportunity to discover new tools and resources used in online tutorials which can subsequently be transferred and applied into the face-to-face environment. Parallel Session 14.3 – Transitions of Online Learning and Teaching: Community 2:15-2:45 How Digital Technologies Shapes Pedagogical Practices in Virtual Chinese Language Classroom (Research-Oriented) Yina Liu (University of Alberta), Jing Jin (University of Alberta) 2:45-3:45 Indigenizing Internationalization and Internationalizing Indigenization: Insights from a Virtual Study Abroad to Ireland, Jamaica, and Aotearoa/New Zealand (Research-Oriented) Michael Cottrell, Kristine Dreaver-Charles (University of Saskatchewan) Keywords: Internationalization, Indigenization, Higher Education teaching and learning, Study Abroad, Epistemological third spaces, Decolonizing curriculum Abstract This proposal aligns with the themes “The Transitions of Online Learning and Teaching” and “Sustaining Positive Change” and reports on the work of a faculty member and an instructional designer from the University of Saskatchewan, where Indigenization and internationalization are leading institutional priorities. We consider possibilities for greater collaboration between these disciplinary and programmatic imperatives for mutual benefit which the shift to virtual learning during the pandemic enabled. We explore the capacity of Virtual Study Abroad course design to synthesize Indigenous and Western pedagogies and methodologies to conceive innovative curriculum consistent with the negotiation of epistemological third spaces through the design of a Virtual Study Abroad course focusing on educational systems in Ireland, Jamaica and New Zealand. Themes emerging from the data include the capacity of virtual learning to enhance the democratization of knowledge and the potential of participatory pedagogies and innovative assessment approaches to decolonize curriculum. Ultimately, we hope that this work will inform new institutional models, whereby Indigenization strategies serve to decolonize internationalization programs and Indigenization efforts are advanced through innovative programming emanating from internationalization imperatives and initiatives. Such a reconceptualization holds the promise of mobilizing Higher Education in the service of social justice and the ‘global good’. Parallel Session 14.4 – Sustaining Positive Change: Open Provocations and Perspectives: A Work in Progress Learning Design Framework (Practice-Oriented) Michael Paskevicius (University of Victoria), Michelle Harrison (Thompson Rivers University), and Irwin DeVries (Royal Roads University) Keywords: learning design, open pedagogy, Critical Pedagogy Abstract In this presentation we provide an update on the development of an experimental variation on the open textbook concept. Originally introduced as an “untextbook” in its early stages, as a customized WordPress site we are now calling it an open digital learning resource. Both scholars and graduate students have been invited to contribute as well as participate in further developing the concept through the submission of provocations. With a focus on learning design, the resulting digital publication is designed in a manner to permit an ongoing evolution, extension and reframing of the original content in learning environments. In response to the provocations, students have been invited, through a series of prompts, to engage with this resource as part of their coursework in a process of ongoing co-creation in a manner consistent with open licensing and pedagogy. In particular it is designed to encourage student responses from critical perspectives including issues, lenses, role perspectives, settings. While the focus of this text is learning design, we envision that the model can be adapted to any other field of inquiry where knowledge is continually evolving or problematized and there is a desire to invite and incorporate alternative perspectives in the educational setting. Open Learning Design: Principles &amp; Practices (Practice-Oriented) Verena Roberts (University of Calgary &amp; Thompson Rivers University), Leo Havemann (University College London), Helen Dewaard (Lakehead University &amp; University of British Columbia) Keywords: open learning design, open educational practices, learning design Abstract This presentation will consider principles of open learning design, as explored in our forthcoming book chapter which considers the position of open learning designers as ‘Thirdspace professionals’, and highlights our lens as open advocates, open researchers as well as learning designers within higher education (HE) contexts. An intentional, reflective, and open learning design can provide the impetus for a “rethink and redesign” (Ladson-Billings, 2021, p. 73) of teaching and learning environments and curricula. How faculty perceptions of and experiences with open access and predatory publications impact teaching and learning (Research-Oriented) Richard Hayman (Mount Royal University) Keywords: Open access, Scholarly communications, Academic publishing, Teaching and learning Abstract This presentation presents the results of a research study examining scholars’ awareness and attitudes toward open access (OA) and predatory publishing at a teaching-focused, undergraduate-only university. These faculty (n=154) responded to closed- and open-ended survey questions about their experiences and knowledge using and identifying both quality open access OA and predatory publishing resources as part of their research, teaching, and assessment practices. The results show that while generally supportive of OA, faculty continue to misunderstand OA and are unlikely to use OA resources in their teaching or research. Worse, many did not express strong confidence in their ability to identify and predatory publishers nor to explain predatory publishing to students. Ultimately, scholars may be ill-equipped to teach students and early researchers about open access and predatory publishing practices. This session will primarily highlight the study results focused on the teaching and learning impacts, and seek to address some implications for how new researchers are to gain the essential skills and knowledge needed to navigate the academic publishing landscape. Conestoga OER Teaching Case Journal: Creating a peer-reviewed, openly licensed, and accessible teaching case journal at Conestoga College (Practice-Oriented) Kevin McDermott, Jane Gravill, Fatih Yegal, Kimberlee Carter (Conestoga College) Keywords: OER, Teaching Case Journal, Case Writing, Openly licensed business cases Abstract Conestoga College is a student-centric community college that services a diverse population of students from a variety of socio-economic backgrounds in south-western Ontario, Canada. To ensure equality for students with less financial means by keeping course material costs low, a group of faculty and administrative staff have created an initiative to encourage faculty members to create quality, OER pedagogical business cases for use in courses. This multi-faceted case writing, and publishing initiative includes three operational pillars: 1) case workshops to help faculty members develop their case writing skills; 2) case roundtable discussions to encourage collaboration and feedback on in-development cases, and; 3) the Conestoga OER Teaching Case Journal, a peer-reviewed, open and accessible, teaching case journal, targeting the submission of cases from a variety of business disciplines. In this session, we will discuss our initial findings related to the efficacy of this initiative and will solicit feedback and collaboration from colleagues. Parallel Session 14.5 – Wildcard: Open 2:15-2:45: Wildcard: 10-min ALT Format Fostering Resiliency in Online Learners: A Blended Test Anxiety Intervention Jacqueline Yu Keywords: test anxiety, online learning, K-12 schools Abstract Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, many students are facing potential learning gaps due to periods of emergency teaching, and they lack practice with regulating exam stress. In connection, test anxiety concerns remain a pressing issue in schools. In Alberta, students were initially scheduled to write provincially mandated diploma examinations during the 2021-2 school year; January exams were cancelled, but a decision has not yet been made about upcoming administrations (Government of Alberta, 2021). Although various forms of e-proctoring have garnered interest, research has yet to determine whether such conditions help prepare students for in-person testing or if they foster greater anxiety (Eaton &amp; Turner, 2020). Developed for an online K-12 school, this presentation will highlight a blended test anxiety resource intended to help grade 12 students face in-person standardized testing with confidence. For its asynchronous component, students receive access to web-based content based on the key components of Putwain et al.’s (2014) Strategies to Tackle Exam Pressure and Stress (STEPS). On in-person exam days, students will also receive access to regulatory tools through calming kits. The Liberated Learner: How to Learn with Style Terry Greene (Trent University), Giulia Forsythe (Brock University) Keywords: education, post-secondary, online learning, study skills, collaboration, learning technology, open education, OER Abstract The Liberated Learner, funded by the eCampusOntario Virtual Learning Strategy, is an inter-institutional collaboration that brings together student co-designers and elearning professionals. This open resource consists of four modules that mirror the Ontario Extend for Educators modules (Lopes &amp; Porter, 2018), but are customised to the learner context. These modules are Learner (learning strategies), Technologist (digital fluency skills), Collaborator (communication, group work, community member), &amp; Navigator (curating, fact checking, other scholarly skills). The goal is to provide learners a similar opportunity to gain confidence and independence in their post-secondary experience online. Recognizing that most issues post-secondary students face are complex and ill-structured (Cormier, 2021), the design and development of the Liberated Learner open modules were primarily student-led. During a week-long design sprint, 120 students generated 99 wicked problems. This collection of personal stories document students’ real life post-secondary challenges. These stories then informed the content of the 4 modules as they were developed together with student co-designers from each institution. They also provided a pathway into the Liberated Leaner modular support at multiple levels of experience (beginner, intermediate, advanced). Each module also consists of a student created Beats to Study to intro to help learners get into the learning groove. The role of inquiry-based information literacy curriculum design in fostering self-efficacy in the digital learning environment Marta Samokishyn (Saint Paul University) Keywords: Information literacy, Online learning, Self-efficacy Abstract Students’ motivation and engagement have been a subject of concern in online learning, especially over the last two years (Means &amp; Neisler, 2021). The inquiry-based approach in information literacy education has shown to increase students’ self-efficacy and sense of agency (Leat, 2017), promote engagement and cognitive presence, as essential building blocks for the development of students’ critical thinking skills. This presentation will discuss the development of an inquiry-based IL curriculum for the credit-bearing collaborative 1st-year undergraduate course in Social Sciences and Humanities. The presenter will discuss how inquiry-based learning can facilitate self-efficacy in the digital learning environments, as we move forward. 2:45-3:45 Learning In the Open: The Journey of Creating and Implementing Open Web-Based Portfolio Templates (Practice-Oriented) Melanie Laurie (Fraser Health), Jamie Drozda (Thompson Rivers University) Keywords: ePortfolio, digital competencies, open Abstract The authors will discuss the process of building WordPress sites as ePortfolio templates for faculty and students to adopt in their coursework and as digital spaces to showcase their learning. Eportfolios themselves are not a novel innovation of the pandemic, however, they were used in creative ways to replace field work, practicums, and art galleries. The authors saw a desperate need for faculty and students to be supported with open source portfolio technologies. In addition, many faculty and students had little technical expertise or funds to develop a website or ePortfolio, which is why the authors developed a series of clonable WordPress ePortfolio template sites. Initially, their aim was to support students by creating open ePortfolio templates with a simple structure and step-by-step instructions for website building, artifact curation and reflection. As they implemented the ePortfolio templates into their respective workplaces, they humbly realized how large some of the technical and pedagogical gaps in understanding can be and so an iterative approach was taken to refine the authors’ instructional process, and the templates themselves were revamped to be more user friendly for the beginner content creator. Break (3:45 – 4:00) Social Session (4:00 – 4:30) Dr Jones (DJ) Beats Parallel Session 15 (4:30 – 5:30) Parallel Session 15.1 – Sustaining Positive Change: PSE Online Teacher Education Practicum During the Pandemic: Zooming In (Practice-Oriented) Christine Ho Younghusband (University of Northern British Columbia) Keywords: practicum, teacher education, remote learning, video conferencing, program evaluation, policy Abstract Universities in British Columbia pivoted to remote online learning in March 2020 and remained online in the upcoming school year. Teacher Education Programs also pivoted to remote online learning, with exception to practicum. Teacher candidates returned K-12 schools for practicum as of the Fall 2020 term while coursework at universities remained online. Teacher candidates were placed in their home communities, if possible, for practicum. At one university, some teacher candidates were formally observed and supported by the practicum mentor remotely due to limited staffing, location of placement, and COVID safety protocols. Formal observations and pre- and post-conferences with the Teacher Candidate were held on Zoom. This session will discuss the pros and cons of remote observations for practicum, privacy and policy issues, and recommendations regarding the use of video conferencing applications for formal observations. Equipping Pre-Service Teacher Candidates for a Post-Pandemic Reality: Building e-Pedagogy Skills and Connecting Theory to Praxis (Practice-Oriented) Karen Roeck (Heritage Christian Online School), Nina Pak Lui (Trinity Western University) Keywords: educational technology, e-pedagogy, teacher education, practicum Abstract This practice-oriented session addresses two identified gaps: (a) the absence of e-pedagogy skill development in teacher education programs (e.g., strategies specific to online teaching) (Serdyukov, 2015); and (b) a lack of ongoing opportunities for teacher education students to apply content and pedagogical knowledge in real classrooms guided by mentor teachers. This session is relevant to the conference themes of “The Transitions of Online Learning and Teaching” and “Sustaining Positive Change.” Our work was guided by three inquiry questions: What skills do 21st century teachers need to create inclusive, equitable, human-centred learning environments and serve students in a variety of modalities? Where should pre-service teachers complete their field experience to best prepare them for all teaching and learning opportunities in British Columbia (BC)? What are the impacts on professional learning of pre-service teachers when they have field experiences with online educators? Parallel Session 15.2 – Sustaining Positive Change: PSE Graduate Ed Graduate Supervision Webinar Series: Open, Online, and Transdisciplinary Faculty Development (Research-Oriented) Michele Jacobsen (University of Calgary) Keywords: webinars, MOOCs, online community of practice, graduate supervision, faculty development Abstract The Quality Graduate Supervision (QGS) MOOC engages academics from across disciplines at different universities in sharing and examining effective graduate supervision practice. Our MOOC combines synchronous and asynchronous learning activities and rich resources on various topics and issues in graduate education and supervisory relationships. Academics join an online community of practice (OCoP) to discuss and explore transdisciplinary strategies for effective graduate supervision and mentoring. The focus of this paper is the QGS MOOC Webinar series that brings faculty and expert panelists together in real time to discuss and explore complex issues in graduate supervision.  The Weekly Webinar series invites supervisors into live conversations with peers, course instructors and expert panelists. Faculty attendance was high every week. During a demanding semester, busy faculty regularly showed up to engage in dynamic conversations. The Webinars increased supervisors’ sense of belonging in the OCoP and enhanced the value of the course. Online faculty development offers significant opportunities for democratizing knowledge about graduate supervision. The open and online design of the MOOC and Webinar series increased access to a broad and diverse community of professors and enhanced possibilities for collaboration across institutions that leveraged expertise and capacity in graduate supervision.  Parallel Session 15.3 - Wildcard: PSE Online From Crime Scene to the Laboratory: Travel CSI style! Sanela Martic, Stephanie Ferguson, James Bailey (Trent University) Keywords: chemistry, toxicology, forensic science, laboratory, podcasts, videos, slides Abstract How would you like to experience a day in a life of a Forensic Toxicologist?  This session will describe the design and development of digital content MODULES and virtual labs to introduce toxicological concepts for their analysis, reporting and interpretation in forensic context. The MODULE I will focus on 7 classes of toxic chemicals, and MODULE II will overview current testing technologies in forensic science field. Using the interactive H5P Course Presentations which will include slide decks, and podcasts, the intricate link between chemical toxicity and testing will be demonstrated in relation to crime scenes and cases. The virtual laboratory component will showcase 5 independent experiments targeting specific chemical, and how current instrumentation is used for their analysis, reporting and interpretation. Lab videos alongside worksheets/datasets will provide an opportunity to partake in a forensic toxicology lab setting. The assessments by forensic toxicology students will be discussed as well. This project was funded through the VLS eOntario program and Ontario Government. Parallel Session 15.4 – Transitions of Online Learning and Teaching – Open Lessons from the Pandemic: How did a terrible online course make a better textbook? (Practice-Oriented) Rebekah Bennetch (University of Saskatchewan), Zach Keesey Keywords: open educational resource, technical communication, grammar, writing, report writing, public speaking, H5P, case studies Abstract Like all educators in 2020, we struggled with the transition to online learning. The sudden shift to a remote, asynchronous learning environment was a challenge we often had to meet; however, from that challenge came an opportunity.  Instead of staying stuck in our remote course mistakes, we used them to create something new: an attractive, accessible, and inclusive Open Education Resource (OER) textbook for our technical communication course. Our presentation will walk through our process of taking a lackluster online course and turning it into an effective textbook.    Additionally, we will share tips and strategies for designing H5P activities and case studies that stimulate higher order thinking, discuss best practices for making an online text accessible and inclusive, and explain how we sorted through an unlimited amount of existing OER texts to create our own.  Show Me Your Crystal Ball: An Environmental Scan for Usefulness (Practice-Oriented) Jenni Hayman (Cambrian College) Keywords: post-pandemic teaching, multi-modal learning, literature review Abstract In the past year, there have been a lot of articles. A lot of shared ideas and many strategies, tips, and tricks focused on how to manage the continuity of post-secondary teaching and learning during a relentless global pandemic. It’s my sense that we’re not anywhere near the end of this pandemic, despite what some in positions of political leadership might wish or pretend. There is more uncertainty to come, possibly significant uncertainty as colleges and universities begin to pick up the pieces of their shattered perceptions and begin the difficult work of personal and institutional recovery. It is hard to imagine anyone in Canadian higher education (learners, faculty, staff, administrators, employer partners) that has not been negatively impacted by COVID-19 decisions, changes in practice, and shifting priorities. It has been a messy two-plus years of chaos. There has been no lack of advice–and perhaps now might be a good time to sort through some of the recommendations, check the accuracy and usefulness of predictions and strategies, and begin a collection of works that support collective success for post-secondary futures. The purpose of this session is to share some useful works and collect and share new favourites from participants. Opening a Seminal Work for the Next Century (Practice-Oriented) Kristine Dreaver-Charles, Monique Mayer (University of Saskatchewan) Keywords: Open textbooks, Open education resources (OER), H5P, Equitable access, Catalysts of open Abstract This contribution is situated at the University of Saskatchewan, where Open Education Resources have been supported since 2014-2015. During the pandemic we began the work of translating The Lymphatic System of the Dog, by Dr. Hermann Baum into English. Originally published in 1918, Dr Baum’s book has been transitioned into Pressbooks, with the addition of ancillary resources. Balancing the legacy of Dr. Baum’s research with our own innovations in assessment and design engages new generations of learners and practitioners. The benefits for faculty and graduate students in designing and publishing openly must also be acknowledged. Locally designed and produced open education resources created with and by our university community is of significance to the academy. The use of open textbooks in university classes establishes a discourse and refinement of knowledge ensuring quality resources are designed and shared. Parallel Session 15.5 4:30-5:00 – Sustaining Positive Change - PSE Investigating the Conversational Framework as a design approach (Research-Oriented) Maryam Shirdel Pour, Michael Paskevicius (University of Victoria) Keywords: Conversational Framework, Open Educational Resources, Open educational practices, students’ engagement, knowledge creation. Abstract The “Conversational Framework”, which represents a learning design framework for teaching and learning processes, could be used as a guide for integrating Open Educational Resources (OER) into education. With the growing tendency toward open and adaptable pedagogy, OER have achieved popularity as a method for supporting students’ access and enabling contributions to knowledge. These resources provide students with the possibility to play an active role in creating knowledge. However, the development of an effective environment to foster the process of learning can benefit from being grounded in a theoretical framework. The purpose of this paper is to explore the application of the “Conversational Framework” (Laurillard 2002, 2012) in designing effective educational experiences and specifically how OER may support students’ learning and engagement. Moreover, it will be discussed how this framework can help teachers consider how to design open learning experiences. 5:00-5:30 – Addressing the New Inequities - PSE Defining Diversity in the Development of a Health Education Media Library (Practice-Oriented) Danielle Dilkes (University of Western Ontario) Keywords: open education, media, representation, cataloguing, participatory design, diversity, diversity theatre Abstract This interactive session is a reflection on the complexity of diversity and representation in the design of educational materials using the example of the development of the Health Education Media Library, a project funded by the 2021 eCampus Virtual Learning Strategy. This project was a response to the challenges of finding high-quality, diverse and inclusive media while creating health education content. The proposed solution was a community-sourced library of images, video and audio that would be made widely available for health educators. As the project evolved, however, this simplistic approach revealed the complexity of diversity work in higher education, starting with the not simple task of defining diversity, how that definition can codify identity, and the implications of that definition including some groups and excluding others. This session will provide an opportunity to reflect on some of the questions and considerations that were raised through the initial phase of the Health Education Media Library project, linking them to broader diversity discourse in higher education, curricular design, and media cataloguing. The session will reflect on the importance of how we approach this work and who is included, concluding with a reimagining of the participatory design of the project. Break( 5:30 – 6:00) #tresdancing - Invited Speakers (6:00 – 6:45) Short Film Screening and Q&amp;A with Filmmakers sava saheli singh, University of Ottawa (co-producer) Tim Maughan (script writer) Hingman Leung (director) Lesley Marshall (co-producer) Keywords: ed tech, surveillance, AR, acab Abstract The sudden shift from in-person to online classes due to COVID 19 has led to increasingly invasive surveillance technologies in education, including the use of problematic online proctoring software purportedly aimed at addressing academic integrity. #tresdancing, the fourth film in the Screening Surveillance series (www.screeningsurveillance.com), speculates on the effects of escalating surveillance and control through educational technology. In this near future fiction narrative, a young person has little choice as they are forced to ramp up their engagement with a new, experimental technology in order to make up for a failing grade.

Change research is a form of praxis - the space and processes by which theory and practice are enacted, embodied and realized in a reflexive manner by implementing and studying innovation in education. I focus on how and why design-based research – a collection of methodological principles and approaches to studying innovative educational interventions in complex, real-world settings – bridges the theory-practice gap in sponsoring praxis and innovation in technology-enabled education.

Before using survey data to draw inferences, researchers need to evaluate the quality of survey data through statistical analysis and visualizations. This workshop aims to provide a step-by-step guideline on how to analyze and visualize survey questions using open-source software programs. The workshop will begin with a brief summary of statistical techniques and data visualization tools used for analyzing survey data. Then, participants will be provided with hands-on training on how to use open-source software programs (e.g., JASP and jamovi) to visualize and analyze survey data. The target audience for this session includes graduate students, researchers interested in analyzing survey data, and practitioners working with data from surveys, questionnaires, and psychological scales.

Participants get a first, hands-on introduction to the system and learn how to start working with it. In the past two years community members have met the challenge of switching to distance learning using wiki based libraries, remixing, editing and creating custom courses. Collaborative text creation exploded. Key improvements were made in ancillary technologies including homework. A common platform allowed rapid introduction of new features. Ease of use by everyone, everywhere became the basic accessibility issue. That applies to making it as easy as possible for faculty to create and for students to reach and use materials that serve their training and needs. It was especially important to provide multiple channels for learner access. Books are available online, via printed books, ebooks, embeddable into LMSs and can be mailed on an SD card as well housed in as a Raspberry Pi with a hotspot. It has been an intense and interesting two years. Parallel Session 17.3 2:15-3:15 An Innovative Approach to Academic Publishing: Open Books Suzan Koseoglu (University of Greenwich) &amp; Royce Kimmons (Bringham Young University) Keywords: Open educational practice, Open scholarship, Open books, Academic publishing Abstract In this interactive and creative workshop, participants will explore open books, an innovative approach to academic book publishing. Open books are open not only in terms of their open access licenses, but also in terms of an openness to finding different ways of engaging in academic work. 3:15-4:15 Share Access!

VIPERs can provide opportunities for learners to engage in experiential learning in a scalable and more cost effective than traditional methods. Unlike specialized escape room programs, VIPERs provide a 360 space and allow for anyone online to access the completed game and for development files, maps and resources to be easily shared. The presenters will take participants through the process for mapping games, creating or find assets and developing a simple 360 space through a collaborative process. The workshop will also cover principles of VIPERs for educational use and intersections with Game Theory. Parallel Session 18.2 CRICKET: An OER for Educational Developers and Instructional Designers Brenda Smith, Marie Martlett, Brenna Clarke Gray, Carolyn Ives (Thompson Rivers University) Keywords: OER, educational development, curriculum development, open education, open educational practices Abstract In May 2019, Thompson Rivers University (TRU) offered its first version of a week-long course (re)design workshop. Recognizing we had been primarily using resources from other institutions, we opted to create our own resources via a one-day facilitated writing sprint. The project grew from being conceptualized as a few stand-alone documents to a large online open educational resource and space for educational developers, instructional designers, and teaching faculty to form a community for open practices. Moving beyond offering resources simply for course design, we decided to create an OER that encompasses three main areas of curriculum planning and design: composition, mapping, and alignment of learning outcomes at the course, program, and institutional levels; choice and alignment of instructional strategies and learning activities; and alignment of outcomes assessment at all levels. This workshop will share the CRICKET (or Course Resource Kit) OER, and session participants will interact with the site through a targeted worksheet and discussion to explore its various features, offer feedback, and share ideas. It will serve to bridge the field of educational development and curriculum development with OER while demonstrating how a range of faculty development professionals can collaborate to create meaningful resources for their campus and beyond. Parallel Session 18.3 The eLearning Design Charrette: A H5P Workshop JR Dingwall, University of Saskatchewan Abstract Creating engaging interactive online activities used to require either expensive eLearning authoring tools, comprehensive web development knowledge and skills, or both. However, this is no longer the case. Participants in the eLearning Design Charrette are invited to complete small challenges using a free and open-source authoring tool, H5P. Originating from the Architectural Faculty of the Ecole des Beaux-Arts in the 19th century (Roggama, 2014), design charrettes have long been successfully applied to complex, complicated, and controversial design problems. A design charrette is “a time-limited, multiparty design event organised to generate a collaborative produced plan for a sustainable community” (Condon, 2008). In the context of this workshop, the characteristics of design charrettes - knowledge creation and sharing, unconscious intuition, creativity, and working in the flow - will be applied to create sustainable learning asset examples for the wider OTESSA community. This workshop begins with an overview of design charrettes for eLearning, after which participants attempt to complete provided challenges individually or in groups. Then, facilitated by an experienced instructional designer and H5P enthusiast, participants will share and critique completed challenges. All levels of experience with H5P are welcome in this encouraging environment where everyone can share their interest, questions, and expertise. Condon, P. M. (2012).

As students develop their projects, they learn to overcome challenges with the technology and to embrace the pedagogy that promotes learning. The process of developing ePortfolios helps foster a community of learners in online spaces. Decades-old research shows that the ePortfolio development process enhances knowledge production, makes visible knowledge application, and capacitates knowledge mobilization. The ePortfolio technology makes affordances for interaction and reflection, encourages both analytical thinking and the questioning of assumptions related to online learning. As multipurpose tools (assessment, accountability, collaboration), ePortfolios are part of a movement that aims to reimagine the way we teach and learn in internet spaces. ePortfolio pedagogy, undergirded by interaction and reflection, integrates authentic learning episodes in digital spaces and enables practitioners to engage in democratizing and mobilizing knowledge. The ePortfolio pedagogy is inclusive, embraces equity, and encourages the sharing of stories, ideas, and opinions among learners. As students engage in idea generation in terms of choice of platform, layout, content, and artefacts, they experience a shift in mindset that capacitates a can-do attitude toward their learning and project completion in online spaces. Transitioning, and Why It’ll Never Be Enough Christian Metaxas, Trent University Keywords: rhetoric, reflection, learning, transitioning Abstract For the last 2 years we’ve peppered each other with polite euphemisms designed to soften the idea that our lives have been irrevocably altered. Phrases like “the before times” and the “new normal” now litter our public consciousness. It perpetuates the idea that if we strap ourselves in, we can white-knuckle our way through the turbulence and successfully transition. A transition is a phase during which something shifts from one state or condition to another. In his video essay, [my name here] argues that to think of contemporary issues as something to transition through is a flawed notion. Identity and life are always in flux, willpower is for chumps, and the only finish lines are the ones you impose upon yourself. Assessing the impact of technological skills on students’ performance: Critical digital literacy and overconfidence bias Marta Samokishyn, Saint Paul University Keywords: Digital literacy; overconfidence; digital technologies Abstract Integration of technology-based skills into digital pedagogy practices has been a focal point of higher education in recent years. However, what is the effect of overconfidence bias on critical digital literacy skills? Through the literature findings and our 2-year quantitative study results, this poster will establish the foundations for the evidence-based approach for the teaching of critical digital literacy in the libraries, and determine what roles librarians can play in delivering the critical literacy pedagogy in the classrooms.
