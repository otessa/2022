Digital
Inequalities in Education by Design

<strong>Keywords:</strong> digital inequalities, design, use
</p>
<h4 id="abstract">
Abstract
</h4>
<p>
Digital inequalities in education have primarily been studied in
terms of disparate technological access, uses, and skills embedded in
academic and social inequalities (Brotcorne, 2022). However, it is
possible to think that digital inequalities are configured upstream from
the use of technologies by educational actors. From this systemic
perspective, inequalities of use represent the culmination of a process
of configuration of digital inequalities that begins with the design of
educational technologies.
</p>
<p>
To account for this, we draw on “social shaping of technology”
studies from a critical perspective, borrowing the “script” metaphor
developed by Akrich and Latour (1992). Applied to digital inequalities
in education, the design and use of educational technologies constitute
one and the same process during which power scripts are progressively
forged and stabilized by certain actors (industrial, political, IT,
educational) at the expense of others, particularly educational actors
from disadvantaged environments. Thus, digital inequalities result from
the greater or lesser convergence between the educational actors
targeted by the design of educational technologies and those who use
them.

The

Abstract
</h4>
<p>
At the beginning of the pandemic, I had just completed my
dissertation research which considered the potential of open educational
practices in high school contexts. I was excited to go back into K-12 to
help support my perceived need for open and online learning during the
time of remote access learning. However, I quickly learned that the open
learning design intervention (OLDI) principles and findings from my
research (Roberts, 2019) had more prospects in Higher Education than in
K-12 contexts. As I transitioned through short-term contract positions,
I am now a contract Instructional Designer at TRU (Thompson Rivers
University) supporting the ZTC Associate Science diploma pathway. My
reflective writing and open learning experiences in open pandemic
pedagogy (Havemann &amp; Roberts, 2021), open participatory practices
including blogging (DeWaard &amp; Roberts, 2021), collaborative picture
books (Roberts et. al, 2020), twitter (Brown &amp; Roberts, 2022) and
podcasts (Roberts &amp; Neutzling, 2022) and open learning design
(Roberts, 2021; Brown et. al, 2021) has inspired my future open research
opportunities (Roberts et al., 2022). This talk will tell the story of
how the pandemic experiences helped me envision the potential of the
Ripple Effect which encouraged me to balance my open learning designer
identity with my professional reality. Participants will be encouraged
to consider their open learning journeys and how to be an open learning
advocate in spirit and as a calling.

COVID-19 disrupted educational contexts worldwide, providing a
possible catalyst for the transformation of teaching and learning.
However, without thoughtful reflection and purposeful planning, a
post-pandemic return to the status quo seemed likely. The presenters
believe that what we focus on determines our perception, and a vision
for an ideal future supports purposeful action in that direction.
</p>
<p>
This session shares the findings of two distinctive studies.
Conducted in unique contexts, both applied an Appreciative Inquiry (AI)
approach to explore experiences during the pandemic to identify what is
needed for future learning environments. Gedak (2021) examined a British
Columbian K-12 school community’s experiences during the pandemic and
utilized an AI SOAR approach with hopes of positively impacting future
district decisions related to education delivery. Waddington (2021)
guided a group of post-secondary faculty through an AI-based
professional development series to support them to reflect on their
initial experience teaching online to identify strengths and
opportunities for development and support future adoption of technology
and online delivery models.
</p>
<p>
The respective findings suggest applicability in other contexts. This
session aims to foster dialogue around maximizing the impact of pandemic
teaching and learning experiences to meet the needs of diverse learners
in a changing world.

Abstract
</h4>
<p>
Research agrees on the fact that the student who actively
participates in the process of his plan of intervention (IP) is
positively linked to the commitment of the parents in the latter, to the
desired learning results, to an increase in the number of high school
diplomas in addition to encouraging interprofessional collaboration.
Unfortunately, research highlights that practitioners make little use of
their collaborative practices and insufficiently promote student agency
during the IEP process. The MIXITÉ collaborative research project adopts
a collaborative partnership approach in which adults collaborate and
maximize their agency and that of the student in the Digital-ACTIVE
process of their IP. A collaborative methodology taking place at a
distance allowed students, their parents and teachers, the management
and the psychoeducator of a school, a patient-partner, social workers
and managers of a CIUSSS to co-create two strategies to be implemented.
attempt to improve collaborative practices focused on student agency in
their IP. This communication presents 1) the process of the IP
Digital-ACTIVE to be tested and 2) the planning of intersectoral
meetings in order to better understand the roles of each and create
cohesion between the actors.

<p>
There is considerable anecdotal evidence that online tutoring
benefits students who participate in these virtual sessions, however,
there is also reason to believe that there are numerous advantages for
the online tutors who modify, improve, and review their regular
classroom practice as a result of their work in the online environment.
While working in this virtual environment, these tutors have the
opportunity to discover new tools and resources used in online tutorials
which can subsequently be transferred and applied into the face-to-face

<p>
This proposal aligns with the themes “The Transitions of Online
Learning and Teaching” and “Sustaining Positive Change” and reports on
the work of a faculty member and an instructional designer from the
University of Saskatchewan, where Indigenization and
internationalization are leading institutional priorities. We consider
possibilities for greater collaboration between these disciplinary and
programmatic imperatives for mutual benefit which the shift to virtual
learning during the pandemic enabled. We explore the capacity of Virtual
Study Abroad course design to synthesize Indigenous and Western
pedagogies and methodologies to conceive innovative curriculum
consistent with the negotiation of epistemological third spaces through
the design of a Virtual Study Abroad course focusing on educational
systems in Ireland, Jamaica and New Zealand. Themes emerging from the
data include the capacity of virtual learning to enhance the
democratization of knowledge and the potential of participatory
pedagogies and innovative assessment approaches to decolonize
curriculum. Ultimately, we hope that this work will inform new
institutional models, whereby Indigenization strategies serve to
decolonize internationalization programs and Indigenization efforts are
advanced through innovative programming emanating from
internationalization imperatives and initiatives. Such a
reconceptualization holds the promise of mobilizing Higher Education in
the service of social justice and the ‘global good’.

Abstract
</h4>
<p>
In this presentation we provide an update on the development of an
experimental variation on the open textbook concept. Originally
introduced as an “untextbook” in its early stages, as a customized
WordPress site we are now calling it an open digital learning resource.
Both scholars and graduate students have been invited to contribute as
well as participate in further developing the concept through the
submission of provocations. With a focus on learning design, the
resulting digital publication is designed in a manner to permit an
ongoing evolution, extension and reframing of the original content in
learning environments. In response to the provocations, students have
been invited, through a series of prompts, to engage with this resource
as part of their coursework in a process of ongoing co-creation in a
manner consistent with open licensing and pedagogy. In particular it is
designed to encourage student responses from critical perspectives
including issues, lenses, role perspectives, settings. While the focus
of this text is learning design, we envision that the model can be
adapted to any other field of inquiry where knowledge is continually
evolving or problematized and there is a desire to invite and
incorporate alternative perspectives in the educational setting.

<p>
This presentation presents the results of a research study examining
scholars’ awareness and attitudes toward open access (OA) and predatory
publishing at a teaching-focused, undergraduate-only university. These
faculty (n=154) responded to closed- and open-ended survey questions
about their experiences and knowledge using and identifying both quality
open access OA and predatory publishing resources as part of their
research, teaching, and assessment practices. The results show that
while generally supportive of OA, faculty continue to misunderstand OA
and are unlikely to use OA resources in their teaching or research.
Worse, many did not express strong confidence in their ability to
identify and predatory publishers nor to explain predatory publishing to
students. Ultimately, scholars may be ill-equipped to teach students and
early researchers about open access and predatory publishing practices.
This session will primarily highlight the study results focused on the
teaching and learning impacts, and seek to address some implications for
how new researchers are to gain the essential skills and knowledge
needed to navigate the academic publishing landscape.

Conestoga College is a student-centric community college that
services a diverse population of students from a variety of
socio-economic backgrounds in south-western Ontario, Canada. To ensure
equality for students with less financial means by keeping course
material costs low, a group of faculty and administrative staff have
created an initiative to encourage faculty members to create quality,
OER pedagogical business cases for use in courses. This multi-faceted
case writing, and publishing initiative includes three operational
pillars: 1) case workshops to help faculty members develop their case
writing skills; 2) case roundtable discussions to encourage
collaboration and feedback on in-development cases, and; 3) the
Conestoga OER Teaching Case Journal, a peer-reviewed, open and
accessible, teaching case journal, targeting the submission of cases
from a variety of business disciplines. In this session, we will discuss
our initial findings related to the efficacy of this initiative and will
solicit feedback and collaboration from colleagues.

Abstract
</h4>
<p>
Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, many students are facing potential
learning gaps due to periods of emergency teaching, and they lack
practice with regulating exam stress. In connection, test anxiety
concerns remain a pressing issue in schools. In Alberta, students were
initially scheduled to write provincially mandated diploma examinations
during the 2021-2 school year; January exams were cancelled, but a
decision has not yet been made about upcoming administrations
(Government of Alberta, 2021). Although various forms of e-proctoring
have garnered interest, research has yet to determine whether such
conditions help prepare students for in-person testing or if they foster
greater anxiety (Eaton &amp; Turner, 2020). Developed for an online K-12
school, this presentation will highlight a blended test anxiety resource
intended to help grade 12 students face in-person standardized testing
with confidence. For its asynchronous component, students receive access
to web-based content based on the key components of Putwain et al.’s
(2014) Strategies to Tackle Exam Pressure and Stress (STEPS). On
in-person exam days, students will also receive access to regulatory
tools through calming kits.

The Liberated Learner, funded by the eCampusOntario Virtual Learning
Strategy, is an inter-institutional collaboration that brings together
student co-designers and elearning professionals. This open resource
consists of four modules that mirror the Ontario Extend for Educators
modules (Lopes &amp; Porter, 2018), but are customised to the learner
context. These modules are Learner (learning strategies), Technologist
(digital fluency skills), Collaborator (communication, group work,

scholarly skills). The goal is to provide learners a similar opportunity
to gain confidence and independence in their post-secondary experience
online.
</p>
<p>
Recognizing that most issues post-secondary students face are complex
and ill-structured (Cormier, 2021), the design and development of the
Liberated Learner open modules were primarily student-led. During a
week-long design sprint, 120 students generated 99 wicked problems. This
collection of personal stories document students’ real life
post-secondary challenges. These stories then informed the content of
the 4 modules as they were developed together with student co-designers
from each institution. They also provided a pathway into the Liberated
Leaner modular support at multiple levels of experience (beginner,
intermediate, advanced). Each module also consists of a student created

education has shown to increase students’ self-efficacy and sense of
agency (Leat, 2017), promote engagement and cognitive presence, as
essential building blocks for the development of students’ critical
thinking skills. This presentation will discuss the development of an

The authors will discuss the process of building WordPress sites as
ePortfolio templates for faculty and students to adopt in their
coursework and as digital spaces to showcase their learning. Eportfolios
themselves are not a novel innovation of the pandemic, however, they
were used in creative ways to replace field work, practicums, and art
galleries. The authors saw a desperate need for faculty and students to
be supported with open source portfolio technologies. In addition, many
faculty and students had little technical expertise or funds to develop
a website or ePortfolio, which is why the authors developed a series of
clonable WordPress ePortfolio template sites. Initially, their aim was
to support students by creating open ePortfolio templates with a simple
structure and step-by-step instructions for website building, artifact
curation and reflection. As they implemented the ePortfolio templates
into their respective workplaces, they humbly realized how large some of
the technical and pedagogical gaps in understanding can be and so an
iterative approach was taken to refine the authors’ instructional
process, and the templates themselves were revamped to be more user
friendly for the beginner content creator.

Universities in British Columbia pivoted to remote online learning in
March 2020 and remained online in the upcoming school year. Teacher
Education Programs also pivoted to remote online learning, with
exception to practicum. Teacher candidates returned K-12 schools for
practicum as of the Fall 2020 term while coursework at universities
remained online. Teacher candidates were placed in their home
communities, if possible, for practicum. At one university, some teacher
candidates were formally observed and supported by the practicum mentor
remotely due to limited staffing, location of placement, and COVID
safety protocols. Formal observations and pre- and post-conferences with
the Teacher Candidate were held on Zoom. This session will discuss the
pros and cons of remote observations for practicum, privacy and policy

This paper will share reflections on the ideation, process, and
outcome of cultivating an open pedagogical practice and the creation of
a collaborative Open Education Resource (OER) with students in a
pre-service education course. The OER co-created by the class is the
outcome of a major class assignment, the planning of a course from the
Canadian and World Studies Ontario curriculum, grades 7 through 12. The
creation of this OER is embedded in a broader shift in course design to
open pedagogical practices and collaborative grading strategies.  
</p>
<p>
The course instructor alongside student contributors reflect on the
ways the enactment of open pedagogical practice, a privileging of
learning processes and collaboration impacted their teaching and
learning environment. Teacher candidates will share insight into their
experiences with modelled open pedagogy, opportunities for critical
reflection, and multi-directional collaboration. For teacher candidates
these experiences encouraged contemplation on the complexities of
enacting open practice and the ways these approaches might be enacted in
the K-12 field while also offering insight on various challenges
involved in such practice. For the instructor, the shifts in course
design brought also brought benefits, opportunities, and challenges. The
experience highlighted the complexity of open pedagogy in practice in
post-secondary education.

The Quality Graduate Supervision (QGS) MOOC engages academics from
across disciplines at different universities in sharing and examining
effective graduate supervision practice. Our MOOC combines synchronous
and asynchronous learning activities and rich resources on various
topics and issues in graduate education and supervisory relationships.
Academics join an online community of practice (OCoP) to discuss and
explore transdisciplinary strategies for effective graduate supervision
and mentoring. The focus of this paper is the QGS MOOC Webinar series
that brings faculty and expert panelists together in real time to
discuss and explore complex issues in graduate supervision.  The Weekly
Webinar series invites supervisors into live conversations with peers,
course instructors and expert panelists. Faculty attendance was high
every week. During a demanding semester, busy faculty regularly showed
up to engage in dynamic conversations. The Webinars increased
supervisors’ sense of belonging in the OCoP and enhanced the value of
the course. Online faculty development offers significant opportunities
for democratizing knowledge about graduate supervision. The open and
online design of the MOOC and Webinar series increased access to a broad
and diverse community of professors and enhanced possibilities for
collaboration across institutions that leveraged expertise and capacity
in graduate supervision.

environment was a challenge we often had to meet; however, from that
challenge came an opportunity. 
</p>
<p>
Instead of staying stuck in our remote course mistakes, we used them
to create something new: an attractive, accessible, and inclusive Open
Education Resource (OER) textbook for our technical communication
course. Our presentation will walk through our process of taking a
lackluster online course and turning it into an effective
textbook.   
</p>
<p>
Additionally, we will share tips and strategies for designing H5P
activities and case studies that stimulate higher order thinking,
discuss best practices for making an online text accessible and
inclusive, and explain how we sorted through an unlimited amount of
existing OER texts to create our own.

Abstract
</h4>
<p>
In the past year, there have been a lot of articles. A lot of shared
ideas and many strategies, tips, and tricks focused on how to manage the
continuity of post-secondary teaching and learning during a relentless
global pandemic. It’s my sense that we’re not anywhere near the end of
this pandemic, despite what some in positions of political leadership
might wish or pretend. There is more uncertainty to come, possibly
significant uncertainty as colleges and universities begin to pick up
the pieces of their shattered perceptions and begin the difficult work
of personal and institutional recovery.
</p>
<p>
It is hard to imagine anyone in Canadian higher education (learners,
faculty, staff, administrators, employer partners) that has not been
negatively impacted by COVID-19 decisions, changes in practice, and
shifting priorities. It has been a messy two-plus years of chaos. There
has been no lack of advice–and perhaps now might be a good time to sort
through some of the recommendations, check the accuracy and usefulness
of predictions and strategies, and begin a collection of works that
support collective success for post-secondary futures. The purpose of
this session is to share some useful works and collect and share new
favourites from participants.

Abstract

<p>
This contribution is situated at the University of Saskatchewan,
where Open Education Resources have been supported since 2014-2015.
During the pandemic we began the work of translating The Lymphatic
System of the Dog, by Dr. Hermann Baum into English. Originally
published in 1918, Dr Baum’s book has been transitioned into Pressbooks,
with the addition of ancillary resources. Balancing the legacy of
Dr. Baum’s research with our own innovations in assessment and design
engages new generations of learners and practitioners. The benefits for
faculty and graduate students in designing and publishing openly must
also be acknowledged. Locally designed and produced open education
resources created with and by our university community is of
significance to the academy. The use of open textbooks in university
classes establishes a discourse and refinement of knowledge ensuring
quality resources are designed and shared.

Abstract
</h4>
<p>
The “Conversational Framework”, which represents a learning design
framework for teaching and learning processes, could be used as a guide
for integrating Open Educational Resources (OER) into education. With
the growing tendency toward open and adaptable pedagogy, OER have
achieved popularity as a method for supporting students’ access and
enabling contributions to knowledge. These resources provide students
with the possibility to play an active role in creating knowledge.
However, the development of an effective environment to foster the
process of learning can benefit from being grounded in a theoretical
framework. The purpose of this paper is to explore the application of
the “Conversational Framework” (Laurillard 2002, 2012) in designing
effective educational experiences and specifically how OER may support
students’ learning and engagement. Moreover, it will be discussed how
this framework can help teachers consider how to design open learning
experiences.

Abstract
</h4>
<p>
This interactive session is a reflection on the complexity of
diversity and representation in the design of educational materials
using the example of the development of the Health Education Media
Library, a project funded by the 2021 eCampus Virtual Learning Strategy.
This project was a response to the challenges of finding high-quality,
diverse and inclusive media while creating health education content. The
proposed solution was a community-sourced library of images, video and
audio that would be made widely available for health educators. As the
project evolved, however, this simplistic approach revealed the
complexity of diversity work in higher education, starting with the not
simple task of defining diversity, how that definition can codify
identity, and the implications of that definition including some groups
and excluding others. This session will provide an opportunity to
reflect on some of the questions and considerations that were raised
through the initial phase of the Health Education Media Library project,
linking them to broader diversity discourse in higher education,
curricular design, and media cataloguing. The session will reflect on
the importance of how we approach this work and who is included,
concluding with a reimagining of the participatory design of the
project.

Abstract
</h4>
<p>
The sudden shift from in-person to online classes due to COVID 19 has
led to increasingly invasive surveillance technologies in education,
including the use of problematic online proctoring software purportedly
aimed at addressing academic integrity.
</p>
<p>
#tresdancing, the fourth film in the Screening Surveillance series
(www.screeningsurveillance.com), speculates on the effects of escalating
surveillance and control through educational technology. In this near
future fiction narrative, a young person has little choice as they are
forced to ramp up their engagement with a new, experimental technology
in order to make up for a failing grade.
